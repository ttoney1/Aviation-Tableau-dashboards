Tableau Dashboards

This Tableau dashboard was made for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (Booz Allen Hamilton federal client).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dashboard contains the below 5 tabs that users can click through to view various visualizations.
All dashboards with maps or charts allow users to filter by foreign countries displayed in that visual. User can hover over all visuals to display tooltips that will show the information from table for that visual. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabs:
1.GLIDE Acronyms & References
An interactive table that allows the user to filter by category by clicking on a tab for that category. It displays a reference page defining acronyms and key terms related to aviation, emissions, and international aviation bodies.

2.Carbon Emissions (Metric Tons CO2)
An interactive world map, bar chart, and table comparing 2010 CO₂ emissions by region (specific countries) from civil aviation operations, showing emissions volumes per region. 

3. Aerospace & AJF Industries & Partnerships
A world map and table categorizing specific foreign countries based on their participation in the aerospace industry and/or alternative jet fuel (AJF) development or partnerships.

4. CO2 Emissions vs. Industries & Partnerships
A comparative bar chart aligning specific countries’ 2010 CO₂ emissions with their involvement in aerospace and AJF industries or partnerships.

5. Summary of Environmental Information
A detailed table summarizing environmental metrics per country, including CO₂ emissions, geographic and organizational classifications, and participation in environmental initiatives (e.g., CORSIA, CAEP).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP)'s 10th meeting (CAEP/10)
 standard aims to reduce aviation's climate impact by driving the development and adoption of more fuel-efficient aircraft designs.

 Conclusion:

Based on the dashboar, countries with high aviation-related CO₂ emissions—such as the United Kingdom, Germany, United Arab Emirates, France, and South Korea (also United States and China based on typical global aviation trends but not shown in dashboard)—but limited involvement in alternative jet fuel (AJF) initiatives or sustainability partnerships, should prioritize investing in cleaner aviation technologies and international collaborations. Expanding AJF development and strengthening environmental policies could significantly reduce their emissions impact. Targeted efforts in these high-emission yet under-engaged countries would yield the greatest environmental benefit.
